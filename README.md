# Data Structures and Strings in Python

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate the use of **dictionaries** and **list slicing** in Python.

## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
**File:** `task1_student_marks.py`

### Problem Statement:
- Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
- Asks the user to input a student's name.
- Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
- If the student's name is not found, displays an appropriate message.

### Expected Output:

Enter the student's name: Alice
Alice's marks: 85

```

If the student does not exist:
```

Enter the student's name: John
Student not found.

```

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
**File:** `task2_list_slicing.py`

### Problem Statement:
- Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extracts the first five elements from the list.
- Reverses these extracted elements.
- Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

### Expected Output:
```

Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
